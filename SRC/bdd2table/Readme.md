#BDD2Table
This directory contains the MATLAB functions which transform the original BDD file (generated by STSLib) to the look-up table. Firstly, copy all the files ending with "cn" from the STSLib directory, which means the control function of a certain controllable function. Then prepare the input data including 
	name : a cell contains the superstate name 
	state: a matrix contains the state number and necessary bit
	number of each superstate
	event_list: a cell contains the event name which should be proecessed.
	SupervisorName: the prefix string of BDD file.
An example input is stored in "WrapperInput.mat". Then, run "main.m". The generated supervisor can be used in logic control.
